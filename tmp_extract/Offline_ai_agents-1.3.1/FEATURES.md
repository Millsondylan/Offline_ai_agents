## üìä Production Readiness Features

### Automated Quality Gates

Every task runs through multiple quality gates:

1. **Syntax Validation**
   - Checks: Python syntax errors
   - Tool: `python3 -m py_compile`
   - Required: Yes

2. **Test Execution**
   - Checks: All tests pass
   - Tool: `pytest`
   - Required: Yes

3. **Code Quality**
   - Checks: Linting, formatting
   - Tools: `ruff check`, `ruff format`
   - Required: Optional (configurable)

4. **Security Scanning**
   - Checks: Vulnerability detection
   - Tools: `bandit`, `semgrep`, `pip-audit`
   - Required: Yes (critical issues)

5. **Type Safety**
   - Checks: Type hints correctness
   - Tool: `mypy`
   - Required: Optional

6. **Code Coverage**
   - Checks: Test coverage threshold
   - Tool: `pytest --cov`
   - Required: Optional (default 80%)

### Continuous Verification

Tasks are verified continuously:
- After each code change
- Before commits
- During execution
- At task completion

### Fail-Fast Behavior

Critical failures abort immediately:
- Syntax errors ‚Üí Stop
- Test failures ‚Üí Stop (if required)
- Security issues ‚Üí Stop (if critical)
